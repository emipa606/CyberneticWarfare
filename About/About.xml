Update of Trunken and Luizis mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1811369911

- CE-patch moved into the main CE-mod instead

Regarding the weapons not recognized as hunting-weapons:
To count as a hunting-weapon a weapon has to have a ranged attack, the projectile must cause damage and it must not be of an exploding type.
All industrial weapons in this mod counts as hunting weapons.
Of the spacer weapons the dual eraser and the accelerator has the above requirements.
Of the ultra weapons the recon bolter and the coil gun works (the latter if put in annihilation mode).
All other weapons use explosive type projectiles.

[h1]Lore (randomly chosen)[/h1]
[i]A wide-barreled multi launcher assembled by some cyberpunks for street wars against the concern. The blueprint quickly fell into the hand of some corporations, which ended up using the replika against their own inventors... on well-trained and paid security forces. The shells detonate on impact, leaving a small poison cloud behind known as the havoc. This heavy form of toxicity destroys biological organs in seconds. The name is kept until now.[/i]
